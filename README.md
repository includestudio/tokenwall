### Token Wall Tale

Master Li has fixed some bugs and wanted to commit the code to the CI, so he logins to the Tokenwall system and finds the related project named TechRadar, and finds out that someone in this project is committing the code for this moment.
He can't get the commit token, so he thinks a cup of coffee is pretty good for this moment.
After enjoyed the coffee, he goes backs and logins to the Tokenwall system again, and the token is available now, so he gets the token and commit the code, and feels good.
After committed the code, he just releases the token and finishes the commit process, secure , easy and without any conflict.
